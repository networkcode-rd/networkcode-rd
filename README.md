- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a favourite childhood memory. As a kid when I was 7-8 years old, I always wondered (and still it keeps my mind occupied) on one single thing. What will happen to me or the soul within me if the world gets destroyed without any warning the very next second? This is the question strike me while I was taking rest in my favourite place.
- Thinking about this question gave me immense sense of importance of life and people around me and especially my family, that I started taking life seriously atleast what I could understand as a kid till date.
