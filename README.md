- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a favourite childhood memory. As a kid when I was 7-8 years old, I always wondered on one single thing "What will happen to us or the soul if the world gets destroyed without any warning the very next second?". This was a very important thought for me as this gave me immense sense of importance of my current existence.
