- 👋 Hi, I’m @networkcode-rd
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Network Technology and its related subjects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...yet to disclose.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new application that can help our Network community.
- 📫 You can drop me an email at ratnavo.dutta.official@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a kid, I had a big imagination. At 7 or 8, I often wondered, 'What happens to us—or our souls—if the world ends without warning?' That deep thought gave me a surprisingly strong appreciation for the present moment!
